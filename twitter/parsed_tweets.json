Since Penpie has been paused, we are now providing a detailed root cause analysis.\n\nThis is a typical issue due to the lack of reentrancy guard. Specifically, the vulnerable contract (0xff51c6, the implementation contract of PendleStaking) fails to consider that the provided argument, i.e., markets, might be untrusted, which can abused to reenter into this contract.\n\nAttack preparation TX: https://t.co/GfqcLFioiO \nThe attacker initially created a counterfeit SY (standardized yield token, i.e., 0x4476b). Although the SY tokens themselves were worthless, the contract was set up with two high-value PENDLE-LPT market tokens (i.e., 0x6010_PENDLE-LPT, 0x038c_PENDLE-LPT) as the reward tokens. By doing so, the attacker then created a market on Pendle and registered it on Penpie.\n\nAttack TX: https://t.co/tyI6SmL5Ao\nDuring the attack, the attacker executed the batchHarvestMarketRewards() function to harvest rewards, which were calculated based on the difference in balanceOf() before and after the redeemRewards() function was invoked. The redeemRewards() function, in turn, triggered the claimRewards() function of the specific market. As the protocol did not anticipate the possibility of a market being maliciously controlled, the attacker was able to re-enter the victim contract through the depositMarket() function. \n\nAfter that, the attacker deposited the two high-value LPT market tokens, which were mistakenly treated as rewards. Simultaneously, the attacker received minted shares corresponding to these deposits. Consequently, the attacker could withdraw the same valuable LPT market tokens along with the corresponding shares minted in depositMarket(), and claim the reward to realize a profit."
